# Employee Attrition Prediction

This repository includes code for predicting employee attrition and optimising model performance using hyperparameter tuning. The dataset used is a "IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition & Performance" dataset, which contains information about employees' characteristics and attrition status. This is a fictional data set created by IBM data scientists.

## Dependencies

The following Python libraries are used in this analysis:

- pandas
- numpy
- seaborn
- sklearn
